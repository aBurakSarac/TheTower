The explanation below is written by ChatGPT for Version 0.1.1

This code is a skeleton structure for a game called "The Tower" using the Pygame library. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1)  It imports necessary modules and initializes the Pygame modules.

2)  It sets up the window dimensions and creates a Pygame window.

3)  It defines some colors using RGB values.

4)  It sets the frames per second (FPS) and the velocity of the block.

5)  It sets up the font to display text.

6)  It defines a function draw_window() to draw the game window with the floor and a start message if the game has not started yet.

7)  It defines an empty function handle_block() to update the state and position of the block.

8)  It defines an empty function draw_score() to draw the score on the screen.

9)  It sets up the game clock.

10)  It enters the main game loop (while run), which continues until the run variable is set to False.

11)  Inside the loop, it checks for events (like quitting the game or pressing a key).

12)  If the event is a key press and the pressed key is the space key, and the game has not started yet, it sets is_started to True.

13)  It then calls handle_block() to update the block position and state, and draw_window() to draw the game window with the updated information.

Please note that the code provided is a skeleton and contains some empty functions (handle_block() and draw_score()) that need to be implemented with the desired game logic.
